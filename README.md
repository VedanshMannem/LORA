This is my very own lora puck compatible with many I2C sensors. This can be used to trasmit information over long distances. This is my second large scale PCB project, and I learned a TON through this project. I've gotten better at making schematics, routing PCBs, and got to work with 4 layer PCBs. This is definitely hardware project until now.
